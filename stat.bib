  abstract        = {The follow-up rate, a standard index of the completeness of follow-up, is important for assessing the validity of a cohort study. A common method for estimating the follow-up rate, the "Percentage Method", defined as the fraction of all enrollees who developed the event of interest or had complete follow-up, can severely underestimate the degree of follow-up. Alternatively, the median follow-up time does not indicate the completeness of follow-up, and the reverse Kaplan-Meier based method and Clark's Completeness Index (CCI) also have limitations. We propose a new definition for the follow-up rate, the Person-Time Follow-up Rate (PTFR), which is the observed person-time divided by total person-time assuming no dropouts. The PTFR cannot be calculated directly since the event times for dropouts are not observed. Therefore, two estimation methods are proposed: a formal person-time method (FPT) in which the expected total follow-up time is calculated using the event rate estimated from the observed data, and a simplified person-time method (SPT) that avoids estimation of the event rate by assigning full follow-up time to all events. Simulations were conducted to measure the accuracy of each method, and each method was applied to a prostate cancer recurrence study dataset. Simulation results showed that the FPT has the highest accuracy overall. In most situations, the computationally simpler SPT and CCI methods are only slightly biased. When applied to a retrospective cohort study of cancer recurrence, the FPT, CCI and SPT showed substantially greater 5-year follow-up than the Percentage Method (92%, 92% and 93% vs 68%). The Person-time methods correct a systematic error in the standard Percentage Method for calculating follow-up rates. The easy to use SPT and CCI methods can be used in tandem to obtain an accurate and tight interval for PTFR. However, the FPT is recommended when event rates and dropout rates are high.},

The size of the decrease of the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate S(t) at time t if one extra event should occur is considered in two ways. In the first approach, the investigator sets a maximum acceptable absolute decrease in S(t) should one extra event occur. In the second, a minimum acceptable number of subjects still at risk is calculated by comparing the size of the decrease in S(t) if an extra event should occur with the variability of the survival estimate had all subjects been followed to that time (confidence interval approach). We recommend calculating both limits for the number still at risk and then making an informed choice in the context of the particular investigation. We explore further how the amount of information actually available can assist in considering issues of data maturity for studies whose outcome of interest is a survival percentage at a particular time point. We illustrate the approaches with a number of published studies having differing sample sizes and censoring issues. In particular, one study was the subject of some controversy regarding how far in time the Kaplan-Meier plot should be extended. The proposed methods allow for limits to be calculated simply using the output provided by most statistical packages.},

When there are equal censoring distributions and the hazard functions are proportional the sample size formula for the F test used to compare exponential samples is shown to be valid for the log rank test.
